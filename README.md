In order to run the code you will need to download and install XAMPP. 

Then in the htdocs folder of xampp paste the folder(you can change the name to something shorter) with the code. 

Run the xampp control panel and click start on both Apache and MySQL.

In the broswer search for localhost/the name of the folder where the code is.

DONE.
NOTE: If you want to have access to the sql database search for localhost/phpmyadmin/.
